# Predict-Credit-Scoring
Develop a credit scoring model to predict the
creditworthiness of individuals based on historical
financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and
assess the model's accuracy.<br>
In this notebook using linear classifiers,such as Logistic Regression,and support vector machines(SVMS)
,and Non-linear classifiers such Random forest and K-nearest neighbors KNN,to potentially improve classification accuracy.<br>
Model Logistic Regression with accuracy  69.6% 
Model SVM with accuracy  93.5%
Model KNN with accuracy   89.7%
Model Random Forest with accuracy   98%
