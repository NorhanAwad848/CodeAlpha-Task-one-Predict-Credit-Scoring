# Predict-Credit-Scoring<br>
Develop a credit scoring model to predict the<br>
creditworthiness of individuals based on historical<br>
financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and<br>
assess the model's accuracy.<br>
<br>
In this notebook using linear classifiers,such as Logistic Regression,and support vector machines(SVMS)<br>
,and Non-linear classifiers such Random forest and K-nearest neighbors KNN,to potentially improve classification accuracy.<br>
<br>
Model Logistic Regression with accuracy  69.6% <br>
Model SVM with accuracy  93.5%<br>
Model KNN with accuracy   89.7%<br>
Model Random Forest with accuracy   98%<br>
